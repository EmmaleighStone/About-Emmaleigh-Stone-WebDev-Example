# Midterm Project: Guess That Gender!

# MVC App Overview

## App Origin
Hi! I'm Emmaleigh Stone, the programmer of the **Midterm Project: Guess That Gender!** I decided to use the Genderize.io API, because it seemed the easiest to actually guess gender accurately compared to age or nationality.*
## Target Audience
The **Midterm Project: Guess That Gender!** was created with a broad audience in mind with the only qualification being knowing how to spell a name and press a button!

## App Summary
The **Midterm Project: Guess That Gender!** is an application. The objective of the application is to allow a user to input any name they want and have the application guess what the gender of that person would be.

## App Play
To start the **Midterm Project: Guess That Gender!**, just type a name into the Name input box, then select the *try now* button! The application will do the rest!

## Conclusion
Thank you for taking the time to read the markdown file about the **Midterm Project: Guess That Gender!** application! I hope you get a kick out of using it, and possibly trying to stump the app with unusual or unisex names!
